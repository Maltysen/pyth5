Pyth is a compact programming language in polish (prefix) notation. It has five data types:

 - int, an integer number
 - float, a floating point number
 - complex, a complex floating point number
 - str, a string of characters
 - list, an ordered list of elements

Lines that start with ";" are comments. Whitespace followed by ";" means that the rest of the line
is a comment. Lines starting with ";#" are meta-commands. There is one valid meta command as of now:

    ;# end
    Everything after this line is ignored by the interpreter, except meta-commands.

The interpreter ignores an even amount of spaces at the start of the line - you can use this to
indent. This is purely for aesthetics.

We will use the following typenames in the docs - these aren't concrete types, they're names for a
set of types:

 - real: int, float
 - num: int, float, complex
 - seq: str, list

In Pyth string literals there are only two escape sequences:

    \\ becomes regular backslash
    \" becomes a single quote

All other characters like newlines, tabs, etc must (and can be) embedded in string literals.
