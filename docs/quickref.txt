Pyth is a compact programming language in polish (prefix) notation. It has three
data types:

 - real, a real number
 - str, a string of characters
 - list, an ordered list of elements

Lines that start with ";" are comments. Whitespace followed by ";" means that
the rest of the line is a comment. Lines starting with ";#" are meta-commands.
There is one valid meta command as of now:

    ;# end
    Everything after this line is ignored by the interpreter, except
    meta-commands.

The interpreter ignores an even amount of spaces at the start of the line - you
can use this to indent. This is purely for aesthetics.

We will use the following typenames in the docs - these aren't concrete types,
they're names for a set of types:

 - seq: str, list

In Pyth string literals there are only two escape sequences:

    \\ becomes regular backslash
    \" becomes a single quote

All other characters like newlines, tabs, etc must (and can be) embedded in
string literals.

0123456789 are used in numeric literals. A leading zero is a separate token, so
*01 is actually 0 * 1.

Now comes a listing of every Pyth operator. Column by column it respectively
contains the operator, the arity (U is unbounded, S is special), the mnemonic
and a description. In the description we will use a, b, etc as respectively the
first, second, etc parameter.

   0 blank    Seperates tokens and surpresses printing.
\n 0 newline  Seperates tokens without surpressing printing.
 ! 1 not      Python not. Returns real: False -> 0, True -> 1.
 " 0 str      String literal.

 * 2 mul      Python *. On real/seq or seq/real truncate real beforehand.
              Cartesian product on seq/seq.
 + 2 add      On both same type, Python +.
              On any/list or list/any respectively prepend/append.
              On real/str or str/real convert to str and concatenate.
